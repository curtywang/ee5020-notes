Looking back from the schematic and the Adafruit Arduino source code, we see that the motor outputs are tied to different pins of our motor driver.  Our motor driver is actually a combination of the PCA9685 PWM driver integrated circuit and four H-bridges that are controlled by PWM.  The H-bridges need three inputs for each motor: PWM (motor speed), in1 (motor direction 1), and in2 (motor direction 2).  If in1 is ON and in2 is OFF, the motor will run one direction.  If in1 is OFF and in2 is ON, the motor will run the opposite direction.  If both in1 and in2 are OFF or ON, the H-bridge will release the motor (no power applied).\n",
