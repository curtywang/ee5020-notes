    "\n",
    "We can numerically obtain the value of $\\pi$ by running a MC simulation with the following model:\n",
    "1. Assuming the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle), then we know that everywhere along the unit circle, the hypotenuse is 1: $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.  We also know that the area of a unit circle should be $\\pi$, since $a_{circle} = \\pi \\cdot r^2$.\n",
    "2. Since our model is simply just $z = x^2 + y^2$, where the constraint for accepted values is $z \\le 1$, choose distributions and bounds for the parameters.\n",
    "3. We assume that the ratio between accepted values and total attempted will be $\\pi / 4$, since we are computing the area of the circle as a ratio to the area of the square.\n",
    "4. Draw samples until the delta of the computed value for $\\pi$ between samples is less than some accepted numerical error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write this up as Python code using `scipy.stats`!  Keep track of the value of the computed $\\pi$ between samples so we can plot it!"
